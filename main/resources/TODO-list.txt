+DONE - Add functionality to procedurally create seeds
+DONE - Add functionality to procedurally create crops
+Add functionality to procedurally texture crop plants (way to use base plant included already while changing stage 7 per item?)
    +Pretty sure this will require a special block instead of using the current crop plant. I can't figure out how to use overlays 
    or subtextures in crops, but blocks seem easily capable?
+Add functionality to procedurally texture seeds (way to change texture HSV on the fly?)
    +Need code to get a color from items first. Then I'll just need the color hex values passed into the current system
+Add command for debug purposes
    +/dc giveseed ITEM
    +EX: /dc giveseed minecraft:plank#2 (gives spruce wood plank seeds)
    
+Add machine for making seeds
+Implement system for balancing seeds (EMC style item worth to determine seed duplication chance and item output?)
+Methods to configure crop drops
+Methods to configure growth time (or implement a subitem system where you have to craft into next items? think essence from MA)
